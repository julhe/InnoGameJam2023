Weather - Rainy
<<ShowCharacter Leonie true>>
You are exhausted from your move. 800 km in one day and carrying all of your belongings
into and out of the truck was harder than you thought. 
The furniture is half built and there are boxes everywhere. 
<<ShowCharacter Monstera true>>
The monstera your parents gifted you is in dire need of water.

You look around your new flat which is small, 
<<SetAnimation Leonie Leonie_emo_sad false>>
but lets your imagination run wild. 
<<SetAnimation Leonie Leonie_emo_Happy true>>
Surely in a few weeks this place will be the coziest in the world and a place for 
your many new aquaintances. 
But enough for today!
Slowly you climb into your bed - the only piece of furniture that is already in place 
You turn off the light, 
<<ShowCharacter Monstera false>>
<<SetBackground black>>
pull the blanket over your chin, and 
close your eyes.

Weather - Cloudy
Your phone rings in the typical Android way. A soft jingle, that lets you oversleep 
from to time because it seriously isn't stressful or loud enough to wake you up. 
<<SetBackground home>>
This time it worked like a charm. You open your eyes.
<<ShowCharacter Leonie true>>
A little bit disoriented you stare into the room. 
Your gaze lingers on the unopened boxes.

You jump unter the shower, shove some of the sweets from the gift basket, your parents gave you for your first 
own flat, into your mouth and get dressed in your feel good clothes. 
Your favorite scarf, your mom gave you 5 years ago, lets you feel nostalgic, as you wrap it around your neck. 
You open your phone to check out "The best insider tipps for new Hamburgers"
